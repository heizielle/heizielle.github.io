Welcome to my little corner of creativity! Here are two hobbies that bring me a lot of joy: **crocheting** and **baking**!

## Crocheting

I love crocheting because it allows me to create thoughtful, handmade gifts for my loved ones. It also encourages me to think creatively and solve problems visually as I work through different patterns

## Baking

Baking has been a passion of mine since childhood. While I lacked the tools and ingredients to go beyond basic recipes in the past, I now enjoy exploring more complex and technical desserts, as well as to tackle the desserts that I had failed baking in the past
